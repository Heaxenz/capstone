# Getting Started with 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Using Capstone of Thrones 

If a unknown url is entered you will automatically be sent to the home page.
The home page will introduce and explain what the site does in more detail.
As well as the source the api that was used to create Capstone of Thrones.
The nav will be always at the very top of the page, and is what will be used to access the other pages in the site.

## Characters & Character page

The character page will get the character data from the api and display each characters name or alias, as well as their gender.
Each character is also used as a button you can click on to learn more about that specific character. This will send you to the character page displaying more informaiton on the character like their spouse, and allegiances.

## Houses page
The Houses page will, like the characters page grab data from the api and display the allegiances in Game of Thrones. Showing the titles of that group, the members, as well as the leaders.
The leader will have a crown button, while the members will have a sword button that will be used to redirect you to their character page.
